# YOLO Model Loading Fix

## Issue Fixed
The YOLO backend was downloading models to the root folder even when identical models were already available in the camera folder (`code_all/6_code_camera/`).

## Solution
Modified `backend_camera_yolo.py` to prioritize local models in the camera folder:

### Model Loading Priority
1. **First**: Check for exact model in camera folder (e.g., `yolo11n-pose.pt`)
2. **Second**: Use any available pose model in camera folder
3. **Third**: Use any available `.pt` model in camera folder  
4. **Last**: Download model if none found locally

### Available Local Models
- `yolo11n-pose.pt` - YOLO11 nano pose detection
- `yolo11n.pt` - YOLO11 nano general detection
- `yolov8n-pose.pt` - YOLO v8 nano pose detection

### Benefits
- ✅ No unnecessary downloads
- ✅ Faster model loading (local file access)
- ✅ Consistent model versions
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ Reduced bandwidth usage

### Code Changes
The `_load_model()` method now:
- Checks current directory for models first
- Uses absolute paths for local models
- Falls back gracefully to available alternatives
- Only downloads when no local models exist

This ensures the camera functionality uses the models you've already downloaded to the camera folder instead of re-downloading them to the root directory.
